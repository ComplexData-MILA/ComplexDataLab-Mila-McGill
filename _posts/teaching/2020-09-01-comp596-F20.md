# Overview

Networks model the relationships in complex systems, from hyperlinks between web pages, An introduction to Network Science, this is a half lecture half seminar course. Networks model the relationships in complex systems, from hyperlinks between web pages, and co-authorships between research scholars to biological interactions between proteins and genes, and synaptic links between neurons. Network Science is an interdisciplinary research area involving researchers from Physics, Computer Science, Sociology, Math and Statistics, with applications in a wide range of domains including Biology, Medicine, Political Science, Marketing, Ecology, Criminology, etc. In this course, we will cover the basic concepts and techniques used in Network Science, review the state of the art techniques, and discuss the most recent developments.
