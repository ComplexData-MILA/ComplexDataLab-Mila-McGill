## Abstract

Meerkat is a tool for visualization and community mining of social networks. It is being developed to offer novel algorithms and functionality that other tools do not possess. Meerkatâ€™s features include navigation through graphical representations of networks, network querying and filtering, a multitude of graphical layout algorithms, community mining using recently developed algorithms, and dynamic network event analysis using recently published algorithms. These features will allow more insightful exploratory analysis and more robust inferences about communities and the significance of entity relationships. Meerkat is under active development, and future features will include additional options for community mining and visualization, focusing on algorithms and user interface designs not existing in other social network analysis tools.
