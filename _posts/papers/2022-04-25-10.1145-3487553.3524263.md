## Abstract

Human trafficking analysts investigate groups of related online escort advertisements (called micro-clusters) to detect suspicious activities and identify various modus operandi. This task is complex as it requires finding patterns and linked meta-data across micro-clusters such as the geographical spread of ads, cluster sizes, etc. Additionally, drawing insights from the data is challenging without visualizing these micro-clusters. To address this, in close-collaboration with domain experts, we built VisPaD, a novel interactive way for characterizing and visualizing micro-clusters and their associated meta-data, all in one place. VisPaD helps discover underlying patterns in the data by projecting micro-clusters in a lower dimensional space. It also allows the user to select micro-clusters involved in suspicious patterns and interactively examine them leading to faster detection and identification of trends in the data. A demo of VisPaD is also released1.
