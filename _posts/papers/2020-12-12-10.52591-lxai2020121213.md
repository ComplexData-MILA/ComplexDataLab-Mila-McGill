## Abstract

Social media trends are increasingly taking a significant role for the understanding of modern social dynamics. In this work, we take a look at how the Twitter landscape gets constantly shaped by automatically generated content. Twitter bot activity can be traced via network abstractions which, we hypothesize, can be learned through state-of-the-art graph neural network techniques. We employ a large bot database, continuously updated by Twitter, to learn how likely is that a user is mentioned by a bot, as well as, for a hashtag. Thus, we model this likelihood as a link prediction task between the set of users and hashtags. Moreover, we contrast our results by performing similar experiments on a crawled data set of real users.
